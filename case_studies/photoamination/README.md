# Photocatalytical Amination Optimization

In a recent [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0537-9) by the Gaunt group at Cambridge, the following chemistry was reported:

This chemistry is a big deal because it enables installation of tertiary amines in complex structures.  

The goal of this project is to optimize the reaction...because the "optimal" conditions in the paper could probably be pushed further.
