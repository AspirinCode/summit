 # Borrowing Hydrogen Reaction

0. The solvent descriptors included with summit were utilized along with the relative solubilties (log10 mole fraction) of potassium hydroxide in the solvents in the database (calculated by COSMO-RS, see [solubilities.csv](inputs/solubilities.csv). Only the UCB Pharma approved list was used, and, in some cases, selections were limited to solvents available in the lab.
2. The initial solvents tested are determined using a modified version of Latin Hypercube Sampling.  See the [Initial Design](initial_design.ipynb) notebook for details.
